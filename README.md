# East Tennessee Relic & Coin Hunters Club
## ETRACH

My first paid coding job!
The guy that runs the club had created the site using Wix and wasn't happy with it so I remade it from scratch.
Multi-page site and I was given design freedom. 
I got some hands-on experience with hosting as he wanted me to move the site back to his original hosting service (Bihira.com)
Also my first experience with cPanel and FTP software.
