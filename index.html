    <p>
      Welcome to ETRACH - The East Tennessee Relic and Coin Hunters Club. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/825727047832962" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If you are from the East Tennessee area or just happen to be visiting our area, we invite to visit and join us. Our meeting location changes every month so always check here for the next location time and place. Our next meeting is March 25, 2017. There will be a fun hunt, followed by lunch, and then our meeting. Please contact either Coinhunter@Charter.net or Rodco37@Yahoo.com for more information.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are a brand new club dedicated to having fun and learning about how to use our machines. Since we are just forming the club you can join now and help custom design the club. We have held several formation meetings and 9 fun hunts. So far our members have found and recovered silver coins on 7 of our fun hunts. At our August 2016 meeting we found and recovered 1 class ring now returned to its owner, and 3 wedding bands. One of these has already been returned to its owner. Plus we were featured on the late news and then we made the ABC Morning News also.
    </p>

    <p>
      This goes to show how working together, doing the research, and then hunting together reaps rewards. We are trying to have a fun hunt prior to each meeting to encourage meeting participation and attendance. One of our club guidelines is we want you to attend the meeting of the month prior to attending the next fun hunt. We have elected club officers, decided upon our Finds of the Month categories, and started our Constitution and By-Laws.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope you find this club a great place to meet new friends and learn more about this exciting hobby.
